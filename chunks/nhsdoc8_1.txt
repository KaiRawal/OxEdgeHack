If you find it hard to get an assessment
It's not always easy to get an autism assessment. Waiting times can also be very long.
If you're finding it hard to get an assessment, you could ask to speak to someone else, like another GP – this is called getting a second opinion.
It may also help to speak to other people who have been in a similar situation.
