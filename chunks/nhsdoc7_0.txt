Signs of autism in adults
Main signs of autism
Common signs of autism in adults include:
finding it hard to understand what others are thinking or feeling
getting very anxious about social situations
finding it hard to make friends or preferring to be on your own
seeming blunt, rude or not interested in others without meaning to
finding it hard to say how you feel
taking things very literally – for example, you may not understand sarcasm or phrases like "break a leg"
having the same routine every day and getting very anxious if it changes
Other signs of autism
You may also have other signs, like:
not understanding social "rules", such as not talking over people
avoiding eye contact
getting too close to other people, or getting very upset if someone touches or gets too close to you
noticing small details, patterns, smells or sounds that others do not
having a very keen interest in certain subjects or activities
liking to plan things carefully before doing them
Autism in women
Autistic women may be more likely to:
have learned to hide signs of autism to 'fit in' - by copying people who do not have autism
be quieter and hide their feelings
appear to cope better with social situations
show fewer signs of repetitive behaviours
This means it can be harder to tell you're autistic if you're a woman.
The National Autistic Society have more information about autistic women and girls
Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:

you think you may be autistic
If you already see a health professional, such as another doctor or therapist, you could speak to them instead.
Getting diagnosed can help you get any extra support you might need.
